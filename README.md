**Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Adidas' sales data using Python. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can enhance sales performance and inform strategic business decisions. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the project aims to identify key sales drivers, uncover trends, and highlight opportunities for growth.
Utilizing Python's data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis encompasses data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Key aspects of the project include:​
Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity.
Data Transformation: Structuring data for analysis, creating new calculated fields, and preparing data for visualization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying sales trends, regional performance, product category insights, and retailer contributions.
Visualization: Generating insightful charts and graphs to represent findings effectively.​
The outcome is a set of visualizations and insights that provide a clear understanding of sales dynamics, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
